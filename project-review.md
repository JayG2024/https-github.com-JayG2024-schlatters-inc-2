# Project Review: Schlatter's Inc. - Phone Support Billing Platform

## 1. Summary

**Purpose:**
A CRM and billing platform for phone-based technical support, with live call tracking, subscription management, pay-per-call billing, CRM, SMS/email, QuickBooks, and OpenPhone integrations.

**Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Vercel Serverless Functions (Node.js/TypeScript)
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Integrations:** OpenPhone API, QuickBooks API, Google API
- **Deployment:** Vercel

**Main Features:**
- Live call tracking and queue
- Subscription and pay-per-call billing
- CRM with client management
- SMS/email from client profiles
- QuickBooks and OpenPhone integration
- Admin and client dashboards

**Entry Points:**
- `src/App.tsx` (main React app)
- `api/` (Vercel serverless API routes)
- `src/pages/admin/` and `src/pages/client/` (main dashboard pages)

**Current State:**
- **In-progress**: Core structure and most features are present, but some areas use mock data or have TODOs for integrations. Some legacy code and mock logic remain. Needs final integration, cleanup, and production polish.

---

## 2. Completeness Check

### **Present:**
- `README.md` (good overview, setup, and features)
- `package.json` (well-defined scripts and dependencies)
- `vercel.json` (custom build/output, function config)
- Supabase integration (`src/lib/supabase.ts`)
- Main admin/client dashboards
- API route stubs for auth, OpenPhone, QuickBooks, Google

### **Missing or Incomplete:**
- **Authentication:**
  - `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` uses mock users; real auth is in `SupabaseAuthContext.tsx` but not fully wired up everywhere.
- **Mock Data:**
  - Some dashboard pages/components still reference mock data (e.g., `mockPlanInfo`, `mockServiceHistory`, etc.).
- **API Integrations:**
  - Many API routes have TODOs for OAuth/token exchange, webhook security, and real data fetching.
- **Testing:**
  - No unit, integration, or E2E tests present.
- **.env.example:**
  - No `.env.example` or `.env.production.example` in root (though referenced in docs).
- **Error Handling:**
  - Some error handling is present, but not consistent or comprehensive.
- **Accessibility:**
  - No explicit a11y checks or ARIA usage in UI code.
- **CI/CD:**
  - No test/build pipeline config (e.g., GitHub Actions) since Git was removed.

---

## 3. Errors and Issues

### **Code Smells & Bugs:**
- **Mock Data:**
  - Some pages/components still reference mock variables (e.g., `mockPlanInfo`, `mockServiceHistory`, etc.).
- **Authentication:**
  - `AuthContext.tsx` uses hardcoded users; should be replaced with Supabase Auth everywhere.
- **API TODOs:**
  - `/api/auth/[...auth].ts` and other API routes have TODOs for OAuth/token exchange.
- **Console Logs:**
  - Most have been removed, but check for any remaining debug logs.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Some API and UI code lacks try/catch or user feedback on errors.
- **TypeScript:**
  - Some type mismatches and implicit any types in places.
- **Dependencies:**
  - Some dependencies may be outdated; `npm audit` found vulnerabilities.

### **Security:**
- **No exposed secrets found** (good), but ensure all env vars are set in Vercel.
- **Webhook security**: Signature verification is still a TODO in some API routes.

### **Performance/Best Practices:**
- **No code splitting/lazy loading** in React routes.
- **No tests** for critical flows.
- **No monitoring/logging setup** for production.

---

## 4. Cleanup & Optimization Suggestions

- **Remove all remaining mock data and variables** from dashboards and widgets.
- **Wire up SupabaseAuthContext everywhere** (replace all uses of mock AuthContext).
- **Complete all API integrations:**
  - Implement OAuth/token exchange in `/api/auth/[...auth].ts` and related routes.
  - Add webhook signature verification for OpenPhone/QuickBooks.
  - Replace all TODOs with real logic.
- **Add `.env.example`** to root with all required env vars.
- **Update dependencies:**
  - Run `npm audit fix` and `npm outdated` to update and patch vulnerabilities.
- **Add error boundaries and user feedback** for all async operations.
- **Add basic unit/integration tests** (e.g., with Jest or Vitest).
- **Consider code splitting/lazy loading** for large dashboard pages.
- **Document all environment variables** in README and `.env.example`.

## 5. Proposed Actions & Fixes

### **High-Impact, Low-Risk (Apply Now):**
- [ ] Create `.env.example` in root with all required env vars.
- [ ] Remove all remaining mock data from dashboards/widgets.
- [ ] Update README with any missing setup steps.
- [ ] Run `npm audit fix` to patch vulnerabilities.

### **Medium/High-Risk (Ask/Plan):**
- [ ] Refactor all authentication to use SupabaseAuthContext only.
- [ ] Complete all API integrations and remove TODOs.
- [ ] Add tests and error boundaries.
- [ ] Add monitoring/logging for production.

## 6. Applied Changes
- Cleaned up mock data and console logs in most files.
- Removed deprecated/unused files.
- Ensured all changes are saved and up-to-date in the local directory.

---

## 7. Next Steps

1. **Review and confirm this report.**
2. **Add official API keys and secrets** to Vercel or your local `.env` file.
3. **Apply the high-impact fixes above** (I can do these for you).
4. **Plan for the medium/high-risk refactors and integrations.**
5. **Test the app end-to-end after fixes.**
6. **Deploy to Vercel and monitor for issues.**

**If you want me to apply any of the above fixes (e.g., create .env.example, remove more mock data, update README, etc.), just say so!**
